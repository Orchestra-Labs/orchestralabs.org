            stablecoins of all types have had their issues. Symphony, however,
            addresses these issues by combining the best aspects of various
            approaches with multiple safeguards. Its dual-elasticity system is
            both algorithmic and crypto-backed, while focusing on supply-side
            solutions rather than price-side patches.

              Symphony's price comes from information cleaning and middle-market
              pricing, but exchanges don't use this, leading to Symphony's first
              balancer: arbitrage. Symphony's algorithmic nature comes into play
              with this initial use of reverse-arbitrage rebalancing, acting as
              a peg in the river so that these exchanges can rebalance against
              us!

              This algorithmic nature is further utilized with the first of

              off by the allowable margin.

              Symphony's crypto-backed nature comes into play with the second of
              its safeguards, triggering after large drops in the value of MLD,
              and utilizing the 2:1 elastic reserves. These reserves are kept at
              2:1 at minimum. When the value of the coin rises, these reserves
              rise past that minimum quickly and easily, making the system more
              secure as circulating supply falls.

            <p className="mt-5">
              The third of Symphony's safeguards is its reserve fee, taken only
              when the reserve balance falls below a 2:1 backing against assets.
              This allows Symphony to safeguard its assets in the unlikely case
              the value of the collateral falls below 50%.

              While either of the previous two safeguards would have prevented
              the UST hyper-inflation crash, further safeguards, such as the
              delayed transactions and partial transactions, as well as the
              multi-key reserves, do not yet have infographics, but are also an
              essential part of ensuring Symphony is able to maintain the
              reliability of its tokenized assets even down to a 99% loss in
              value.
