            While many see the benefits of a price-stable cryptocurrency, due to
            errors in the past, those that construct these cryptocurrencies
            attempt to do so through ever-increasing centralization, which is
            the antithesis to the central tenets of crypto. As a result, despite
            the many failings of centralized systems within the cryptocurrency
            space in 2020, as well as the failures of centralized systems being
            the initial push for the creation of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency
            ecosystem as a whole still finds itself reliant on such large,
            centralized pillars as Tether and Circle.
          </p>
          <p className="italic mt-5">
            As a solution to this, as well as to the speed-limiting
            centralization within the level ones currently on the market, I
            propose a new cryptocurrency, Symphony, which will provide a stable
            peg to many different currencies as well as a decentralized system
            at its very core that allows for unlimited scalability.

          <p className="mt-10">
            The price-volatility of cryptocurrencies is well-known, and the
            majority of the population would prefer to avoid paying for
            every-day goods and services with a currency that has the potential
            to double in value in a few days, or be paid in a currency if its
            value can significantly decline before the transaction is settled.
            This problem is aggravated when the transaction requires more time,
            e.g. for deferred payments such as mortgages or employment
            contracts, as volatility would severely disadvantage one side of the
            contract, making the use of existing digital currencies in these
            settings prohibitively expensive.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            At the core of how Symphony solves these issues is the idea that a
            cryptocurrency able to monitor real-world information will be able
            to create a stable price while maintaining decentralization, thus
            making it viable for use as a transaction medium for other
            cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Assuming use as a currency,
            however, price-stability alone is not sufficient. A currency must
            also have both high speed transaction settlements and a large
            network-effect.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            To tackle the problem of high speed transaction settlements,
            sharding, which is used by the majority of large businesses within
            the software engineering space, is proposed. Even Google and Amazon,
            which have the money to afford large, powerful computer systems that
            can handle large numbers of transactions, use their money more
            efficiently by using load balancing and sharding techniques to
            reduce load requirements for any particular node in the system. A
            lighter load for each node allows for higher speed settlements as
            user count rises to the level handled by these giants in the
            software industry.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            With stability and speed handled, the rest of the work will need to
            be aimed at achieving a large network-effect. This can be done by
            bringing in many developers that can provide a simple, well-designed
            user experience. Any user thatâ€™s tried to work with DeFi knows how
            complicated the cryptocurrency space can be. This is prohibitively
            complicated for those only starting to find out about crypto. To
            that end, those that have had to design a good user experience for
            years in their own space should be invited to the crypto space. This
            can be done by not forcing them to learn a new language to engage,
            but rather to make this space able to handle the languages already
            learned by these developers. Those that create easy-to-use user
            experiences such as the developers that worked on Instagram or
            TikTok know about ease-of-use and good design flow. They write their
            programs in Dart, JavaScript, TypeScript, and other, similar
            languages. Rather than making them learn Rust or Solidity, they can
            apply their current knowledge and focus specifically on a good user
            experience that takes all the learning out of crypto so new users
            can get directly to using it, as they want to do.

            Any given stablecoin is measured by its ability to have any given
            unit of that stablecoin accurately reflect the value of one unit of
            whichever resource it is pegged to. One USD stablecoin should
            reflect the value of one USD, one GBP stablecoin should reflect the
            value of one GPD, and one BTC stablecoin should accurately reflect
            one BTC. Through this, one might say the general objective of a
            stablecoin is to keep a consistent purchasing power. This may be to
            ensure value stability in times of economic crisis, such as when
            users sell into their local currency to avoid a rapidly falling
            stock market, or to keep the future value of oneâ€™s purchasing power
            secure, such as with Bitcoin or gold.

          <p className="mt-5">
            The issues many stablecoins face is how to accurately measure the
            value of this external resource as well as how to properly rebalance
            when necessary to reflect this value in the 1:1 relationship
            previously established.

            a given stablecoin pair in the symphony ecosystem will be referred
            to as a Harmony. If referencing a stablecoin within the Harmony, it
            will be referred to as a Harmony-Coin. To provide an example, USD
            would be Harmony-USD, or HUSD.

              Recognizing that different users will wish to conduct their
              activities in different trade mediums, Symphony aims to peg to a
              family of trade mediums in an order depending on level of use in
              the world. These will include, but not be limited to, trade
              mediums such as the US dollar, the British Pound, and the Euro.
              Over time, more currencies will be added to the list by user vote.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
              It is important for all Symphonyâ€™s Harmonies to have access to
              liquidity from one trade medium into another. For this reason, the
              system will support swaps between harmonized currencies at their
              market exchange rates. Ideally, any user should be able to trade
              HUSD for HGBP at current exchange rates, but failing a system with
              multiple backups for this information, their combined relation to
              Notes will be used, effectively turning Notes into a facilitatory
              trade medium. As the Symphony ecosystem adds more currencies, its
              atomic swap functionality can be an instant solution to
              cross-currency transactions and trade settlements.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
              The manner in which these currencies will be pegged to their
              real-world value will be through the use of Oracle chains, such as
              Chainlink, as well as through a net of relations between the
              currencies currently pegged on-chain. These Oracle chains can be
              used to query for data consistently over time for any resource
              coded into that chain. This can be used to query out to multiple
              exchanges to learn the current real-world value relation of any
              trade medium to any other. Using an example, queries will be used
              to record the current value over several exchanges and information
              resources for each real trade-medium in relation to Notes such as
              USD-Note, BTC-Note, and USD-BTC. What this will allow is added
              security in that to corrupt the information, not only will one
              exchange or information resource have to be compromised, but
              rather a majority over every input included on Symphony related to
              the specific trade medium targeted, as majority consensus within a
              certain margin of error will be taken to determine the next
              balancing action. Given differing security structures for each of
              these resources, this is very unlikely.

              A pool with Notes specifically reserved for rebalancing any given
              Harmony will be created using transaction fees generated through
              use of the network. This will be used to rebalance the system
              using one primary backup and one secondary backup method. The
              primary method is to use this reserve pool to push up the number
              of Notes in the system so that the current total market cap of
              Notes included will be of equal value to the amount of
              Harmony-Coin currently in use. The following diagram shows the
              architecture to be used, with the explanation beneath going over

              Assuming consensus over the various queries results in a marked
              imbalance of paired Note market value vs harmonized trade mediums,
              each possible imbalance will be addressed in the following ways,
              with PMoE being a reference to the Percent Margin of Error and
              HUSD being the exampler:

            At the core of each cryptocurrency is a monetary policy the creators

            vote is conducted and the changes approved, but most
            cryptocurrencies find a fixed cap on coins is best to at least start
            with. Monero and Ethereum are exceptions here.

            Common problems a good monetary policy aims to solve are a maximum

            after adoption to retain users, the transaction fee structure, how
            those running the network get paid, and what to do when the value of
            the unit becomes too large for regular use.

            To this end, Symphony will use a maximum circulating supply of 1
            billion. This larger supply is intended to allow for ease of
            purchase into the future as Symphony begins to take on several of
            the challenges engaged with by the current financial system while
            allowing for a certain allotment of coins towards the various
            reserves where they will be locked until certain conditions are met.
            Symphony will otherwise match Bitcoinâ€™s tokenomics, which are
            generally considered to be good. This will begin with 750 million
            Melody in circulation and begin by providing 431.252 million coins
            in the first four years. This averages to a 3.93% inflation per
            year. This reward level will be halved every four years. This plan
            allows for growth while avoiding an outsized removal of value from a
            userâ€™s coin holdings. Much like with Bitcoin, the maximum supply
            will never be reached, and as the inflation rate drops, miners will
            continue to be paid through fees paid on the system.

            The fees paid from use of the system will be created through a
            summation of the various attributes that require attention for
            continued maintenance of Symphony. This will include a steady miner
            pay of 0.00025% per transaction as well as fees for the reserve
            pool, the developer pay pool, spam, and voting. In addition to the
            basic transaction fee for miner pay, miners on Symphony will also be
            paid through inflation as well as through the fees levied for spam
            and voting.

            Should they require funding, the fees for the developer pay pool and
            the reserve, much like the miner pay, will start at 0.0002% and be
            increased exponentially depending on the amount missing from each
            pool. The sum of all fees on any given transaction, excluding the
            spam fee, should have a cap of 1%, so this increase of the fees will
            not be unlimited. The spam fee is the exception here in that it is
            capped only by the amount sent in each transaction minus the other
            transaction fees. This amount is compounded only for the wallet of
            origin and will begin at 0 Notes, then increase to 0.0001%, and then
            begin increasing exponentially once per transaction sent within the
            same block for as long as transactions are sent within the same
            block.

            It should be noted here that for purposes of maintenance, the
            transaction fees generated when transferring from the miners to the
            necessary pool will not incur any fees themselves. In addition,
            should the maximum cap on the coin be scrapped in favor of an
            inflation based approach, that is up to those users voting at that

            Sharding is a method used by databases to allow for distributed data
            across multiple machines making the overall system more scalable.
            Given that cryptocurrencies store data across multiple machines
            themselves, this is a possibility for introduction into the crypto
            space as well, though it will naturally introduce some new
            trade-offs, as Ethereum, Cardano, and Near are finding now. These
            tradeoffs include the introduction of new challenges such as
            cross-shard communication, data availability, and the shard takeover
            attack, but also include the introduction of new benefits such as
            horizontal instead of vertical scaling, parallel processing of
            transactions, and lowered transaction fees, given transaction fees
            scale on volume within the shard rather than across the network like
            on Ethereum or Solana.

            Three main considerations were taken when determining how to split
            the shards to best reduce the effect of high numbers of
            transactions: geography, relationships between nodes, and
            transaction quantity itself. Symphony will initially disregard
            geography and node relationships in favor of focusing on transaction
            quantity due to the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc mt-5 px-6 md:pl-8">
            <li>
              Geography, while important when considering latency, can likely be
              disregarded, as the chain itself is more to record final
              transactions than constant messages. This parameter can either be
              handled later as new concerns and use cases are uncovered, or
              handled by higher level applications built on top of Symphony.
            </li>
            <li>
              Relationships between nodes, while important when trying to
              minimize cross-shard transactions, can likely be disregarded, as
              relationships between nodes may change quickly, and the downtime
              incurred from rebuilding shards to reflect these changing
              relationships can be problematic to users.

          <p className="mt-5">
            The primary goal of using shards on the blockchain is to minimize
            the effect of large transaction quantities on the network, ensuring
            quick, reliable transactions regardless of the number of users. To
            that end, this approach needs to ensure the following:

            <li>
              Availability: Downtime for nodes while updating state or changing

            <p className="mt-7.5">
              There are three main sharding models being looked at while
              considering how to shard Symphony. These belong to Ethereum, Near,
              and Elrond. Ethereum is applying sharding as a higher layer which
              will primarily boost the capabilities of their level 2 solutions.
              Meanwhile Near uses an approach that splits block production and
              Elrond uses a sharding approach that splits the full state.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
              There are issues that Near claims are more likely on blockchains
              such as Elrond, such as the possibility of forking or a malicious
              block being hidden due to not being checked in time. As mentioned
              in Nearâ€™s whitepaper, in either the case of forking or hiding
              malicious blocks as well as other attack vectors, once the error
              is introduced, it is likely to propagate throughout the network,
              as the benefit of checking so far back is minimal to none for any
              given validator. The safeguards introduced in Nearâ€™s approach,
              however, are likely to fix these mentioned issues regardless of if
              full state is sharded or only the transaction processing. As such,
              it doesnâ€™t seem unreasonable to choose either approach.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
              At present, Elrondâ€™s sharding mechanism is fully online, while
              Nearâ€™s is only beginning to ramp up at time of writing. Elrond
              also seems to have lower hardware requirements, creating validator
              requirements in-range for most everyday consumers. Unfortunately,
              Elrondâ€™s approach of sharding the full state appears to have
              worked at a 1-2 shard level, but began to break down at the 3
              shard level when pulled out of testing into real-world scenarios
              with smart contract utilization. On top of this, despite the
              benefit of Elrondâ€™s lower hardware requirements, the transaction
              finality on Near and lack of successful hacks of its protocol are
              far more beneficial to the larger use case Symphony is targeting.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
              At time of writing it is currently believed that the benefit of
              lower transaction finality time and the benefit of having sharding
              on the main layer as opposed to a higher layer prove Nearâ€™s
              Nightshade approach to be the best option for Symphony. A basic
              explanation of aspects of this approach are listed below:

            <p className="mt-7.5">
              Sharding is set to split the load of creation for each block. This
              split is based on the number of transactions rather than the
              number of nodes. Given this, it is still both inefficient and
              insecure to have too few validator nodes running on any individual
              shard. Sharding too much can lead to easier shard takeover attacks
              and other malicious activities. To that end, shard numbers should
              be able to scale bi-directionally on both the number of validators
              and the number of transactions. Should there be too many
              transactions per shard, the number of shards is increased. Should
              there be too few transactions or too few validators in any given
              shard, the number of shards is decreased.

            <p className="mt-7.5">
              Security for the shards is introduced through the use of fishermen
              and hidden validators. These roles are assigned during each block
              through a Verifiable Random Function (VRF). This will be weighted
              to ensure more reliable validators are more likely to be selected
              for any given role. Simultaneously, the amount of fishermen and
              hidden validators is randomized to prevent knowledge of how many
              validators need to be corrupted per shard, with the hidden
              validators securing their specific shard and fishermen securing
              the transactions of any shard they challenge.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-7.5">
              To prevent other malicious activity from validators, each
              validator will be required to send out the results of their work
              before being able to view and verify the results of others within
              their shard. This forces the validator to validate the
              transactions in their portion of the block, including a potential,
              deliberately included but random error. Failure to dismiss the
              block if it contains the error will naturally result in slashing,
              with the slashed coins being sent to the other validators.

              Onboarding of new validators is one area where Symphony will
              differ from Nearâ€™s Nightshade. Naturally, with the speed at which
              blocks will be produced, new nodes will have problems getting up
              and running due to time delay from downloading the entirety of the
              chainâ€™s data. While this may require another storage solution at
              some point in the future, other chains have been using Merkle
              trees to great success. In this case, onboarding can be done using
              this Merkle tree, allowing any new node to begin validating from
              the last valid state block and compute only the following blocks,
              while downloading the previous blocks of the chain in the
              background.

            With implementation of the base chain to handle data and state, a
            Virtual Machine (VM) layer will need to be built on top of this to
            handle smart contracts and applications. Symphony will build its VM
            infrastructure using web assembly (WASM), which allows for
            compilation directly through the chain for multiple languages and
            higher efficiencies than the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). Using
            this should allow great ease of use for incoming developers. This
            opens up Crypto to the entire Web Development community, potentially
            bringing in practiced User Experience designers who can attract
            non-crypto affiliated, everyday users who might be curious about the
            space but apprehensive about its complexity.

            Due to the high monetary and environmental costs of electricity,
            most chains have moved to staking algorithms for their miners.
            Symphony, for now, will be no exception.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            Proof of Work algorithms have the benefit of protecting users on the
            network from monetary takeovers by rich investors able to buy their
            way into a voting majority. Perhaps, at some point in the future, a
            sharded style Proof of Work algorithm will be beneficial for
            Symphony, but at present, most people in Crypto appear to prefer
            staking algorithms. As such, stakers and validators will be rewarded
            through any transaction fees, slashing fees, and spam fees incurred
            by users on the network.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            The rewards for mining will be split between all validators evenly.
            The reason for this distribution model is the hidden validators and
            fishermen. These less visible nodes canâ€™t be said to have validated
            any given transaction, as their purpose is to validate the checks of
            other nodes. Their purpose is to add security to the network by
            policing other nodes both in their own shard and in other shards.
            They are rewarded for this operation in the same manner as other
            validators.

            As mentioned earlier, rich investors can buy their way into a voting
            majority on most staking-based chains. Voting on Symphony will be
            implemented with one vote per validating address rather than one
            vote per coin to try and curb this effect.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            In addition to one vote per validating address, this vote will be
            created using the aggregated vote of all staking parties, using one
            vote per staking address. The owner of the validator has the choice
            then to approve or deny this aggregated vote. Stakers who dislike
            the voting patterns of their particular validator can choose to
            un-stake and move to a validator with similarly voting stakers or a
            like-minded validator. A small voting fee will be taken to ensure
            those voting are considering the potential gain in value to the
            coin. Naturally, this will also mean fewer stakers on the validating
            node will impact the validator monetarily.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            To this end, the voting patterns of the validators vs the aggregated
            vote will need to be published so that stakers can take this
            information into account along with the validatorâ€™s chosen fees and
            other factors. A messaging system must also be implemented so that
            wallets can display the current vote. In addition to these factors,
            a small transaction cost will be implemented for voting to try and
            encourage voting specifically from the group of stakers that wish to
            increase the value of the token while discouraging multiple votes
            from users with multiple wallets. This voting fee will be paid to
            the miner, should the miner approve the vote. This is to encourage
            the miner to represent their stakers properly. Despite this monetary
            incentive, these miners still have the ability to reject votes they
            feel is not in their best interest, as the point of security for the
            network.

            <li>
              Wagner: This release will enable sharding within block
              composition.

            <li>
              Beethoven: This release will allow for the enabling of the

            Symphony, like any other chain, will have many potential projects
            coming to it, provided the required level of community adoption is
            present. Future work regarding this chain may be completed once the
            work is handed off to the community, but the Orchestra organization
            will continue building for it through contributions to the chain
            itself or applications on it with the following projects:

          <ul className="list-outside list-disc mt-5 px-6 md:pl-8">
            <li>
              Enable holding of multiple wallets on each validator to allow for
              native cross-chain exchanges. Melody will be the transaction
              medium between these currencies, using value relations between
              those chains and Symphony in a manner similar to the Harmonies
              enabled previously.

              With banks beginning to put crypto on their balance sheets at time
              of writing, create partnerships with several banks in various
              countries for them to act as on-ramps for blockchain users with
              accounts at those banks. This allows the banks to profit off
              crypto and simultaneously allows users to use reputable companies
              instead of potentially detrimental monoliths such as FTX. Should
              these partnerships not fail to materialize, create these on-ramps
              using Symphony by registering a neo-bank in various countries.
            </li>
            <li>
              After having gained the approval of the banking system, use this
              approval to gain a partnership with the SEC and the
              security-governing bodies of other countries to migrate the stock
              markets of these countries onto the chain, enabling
              programmability into stock offerings, such as benefits to
              stockholders or direct stakeholder voting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gain approval from multiple governments to use Symphony for trade
              purposes, utilizing third party account as escrow account combined
              with smart contracts to ensure trade completion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gain approval from one or more governments to create a mixer that
              leads to government verified wallets used specifically for voting
              purposes. The mixer here is to ensure no direct link is formed
              between a userâ€™s financial transactions and voting wallet
              identity, ensuring user privacy.
